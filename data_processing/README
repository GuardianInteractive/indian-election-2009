    > sudo apt-get install gdal
    > sudo npm install -g topojson

    # Shapefile to GeoJSON
    ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON india_districts.json \
    census_of_india_district_profiles-_households_and_villages_2001.shp

NOTES
    geoencode.js has been left in as it might be useful again, maybe. It uses
    Google's geolocation API to fetch the lat, lng of all the constituencies.

    NB: Google requires that you use their map if you get the lat, lng from
        their API.
