India election 2009 data processing
===================================

WHAT
    Convert the original data from the Election Commission of India, general
    election results 2009 into JSON.

REQUIREMENTS
    nodejs

HOW
    > npm install
    > node convert2json.js

NOTES
    geoencode.js has been left in as it might be useful again, maybe. It uses
    Google's geolocation API to fetch the lat, lng of all the constituences.

    NB: Google requires that you use their map if you get the lat, lng from
        their API.
